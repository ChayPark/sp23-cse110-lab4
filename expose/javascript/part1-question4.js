This function will return an array containing the discounted prices of the input array. 
The input array is [100, 200, 300] and the discount is 0.5, so each price in the array will be multiplied by (1 - 0.5) which gives a 50% discount. 
The discounted prices are then rounded to two decimal places using Math.round and pushed to a new array called discounted. 
The final discounted prices array will be [50, 100, 150]. The function doesn't cause any errors.
