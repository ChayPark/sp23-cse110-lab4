On line 13, the function will log final result: <result> to the console, where <result> is the value of the result variable.
In this case, since add is true, the code inside the if statement will be executed and result will be assigned the value of num1 + num2, which is 20. 
Then, the function will log 'values added: 20' to the console on line 7.
After that, the code will continue to execute and reach line 13, where the function will log 'final result: 20' to the console, since the value of result is still 20.
So the output will be: 
values added: 20
final result: 20
