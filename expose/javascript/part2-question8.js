The discountPrices function, when called with the arguments [100, 200, 300] and 0.5, will return the array [50, 100, 150].
This is because the function takes two parameters, an array of prices and a discount value as a decimal. The for loop iterates through each element of the prices array, calculates the discounted price by multiplying the original price by (1 - discount), rounds the result to two decimal places using Math.round(), and adds the final discounted price to the discounted array using the push() method. Finally, the function returns the discounted array.
In this case, for the prices [100, 200, 300] and a discount rate of 0.5, the discounted prices will be [50, 100, 150], which will be returned by the function.
There is no error in the function.
