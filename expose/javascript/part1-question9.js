At line 14, the finalPrice variable will be logged to the console for each iteration of the for loop. 
Since the variable is declared inside the loop, it will be re-assigned a new value for each iteration, and only the final value will be logged to the console when the loop ends. 
Therefore, the console will output the final discounted price of the last item in the prices array (which is 150 in this case) after rounding to two decimal places. 
There won't be any error.
