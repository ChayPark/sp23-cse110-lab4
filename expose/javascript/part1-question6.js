The code will not reach line 13 because of the error on line 7 where the const variable result is being reassigned a new value. Once the error is encountered, the function will terminate and the code on line 13 will not be executed.
The code will throw a ReferenceError: result is not defined when it tries to execute the console.log() statement on line 13. This is because the result variable is declared inside the if block on line 3, and therefore only exists within the scope of that block. 
When the program reaches line 13, it is outside the scope of the if block and the result variable is no longer accessible.
