Line 13 prints the message "final result: " followed by the value of the result variable.
However, if add is false or any falsy value, the function will immediately return without executing line 7-12, which means that result will not be defined. In that case, line 13 will cause a ReferenceError because the result variable is not defined.
If add is true, line 13 will print "final result: " followed by the value of result, which is the sum of num1 and num2 in this case.
