The output of line 9 would be "values added: 20". This is because the function adds the two numbers and logs the result to the console on line 6.
However, line 5 to declare result as a constant variable and then try to reassign it on line 7, we will get a TypeError: "Assignment to constant variable" error at runtime. 
This is because constant variables cannot be reassigned after they are initialized.
So, in summary, the output of line 9 would be "values added: 20" and there would be an error if we try to reassign the constant variable result on line 7.
