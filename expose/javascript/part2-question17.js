We first declare a function named doSomething that takes a number as input and returns that number multiplied by 2.
We then call modifyArray with an array [1, 2, 3] and the doSomething function as the callback.
In modifyArray, we create an empty array named newArr and loop through the input array using a for loop.
For each element in the input array, we call the callback function with the element as input and push the result into the newArr array.
After looping through all the elements in the input array, we return the newArr array.
Since doSomething multiplies its input by 2, calling modifyArray with the doSomething callback function will double each element in the input array [1, 2, 3], resulting in the output array [2, 4, 6].
